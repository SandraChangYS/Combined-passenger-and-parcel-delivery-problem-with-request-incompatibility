Combined passenger-and-parcel delivery problem with request incompatibility

This repository contains the instances used in this research, categorized by the number of requests:
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 requests.

Each instance includes four types of distance matrices based on different scenarios:
SS, SC, CS, and CC.

In addition, each instance comes with a corresponding set of parameters as described below:

d: Number of requests
I_d: Number of passengers
J_d: Volume of goods
f_d: Revenue generated by each request
s_d: Earliest service time for each request
m_d: Latest service time for each request
l_d: Maximum service duration for each request
C_v: Hiring cost of vehicle v
distance: Distance matrix type (SS / SC / CS / CC)
P_v: Passenger capacity of vehicle v
Q_v: Freight capacity of vehicle v
S_v: Earliest available time of vehicle v
E_v: Latest available time of vehicle v
pi_%: ompatibility matrix Ï€, with a incompatibility ratio,
